What the fuck am I doing?

What am I making? A noise visualizer. I will visualize my noise, and also perlin noise.
I also want to see if I was right about perlin noise justing being my noise, but with a 
tilting table (i.e visualize the table).

I guess program will need to be 3D and 2D. 2D for 1D and 2D noise, and 3D for 3D noise.

Ok, I'm starting to think this won't be some quick 1-3 day project, maybe, but it seems like 
it will take, it shouldn't take more then 2 weeks. I doubt it should even take more then 1 week.

Tasks - Expected Time
--------------------------
Setting up OpenGL program - 1-3 days
Adding noise visualization - 1-3 days

Total: 2-6 days (~1 week)

Thats if I work hard! Should I drop everything else? IDK. 

Should I start from scratch, or pig back off some other project I've made, or other peoples code?
I could. Making it from scratch shouldn't be too hard, and it would build my skills up too. I think 
I should, and want to, build it from scratch. So it will use OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM (main dependencies).

What else am I working on right now?
- Going through 6837 lectures
- 3200 A2 

What do I get out of doing this?
- Implement and practice noise
    - Will be able to build minecraft clone
- Practice programming skills
    - Build a program from scratch, 100% on my own.
- Cool unique project to show off! 

HELL YEAH!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What am I building?
- 2D visualization: 
    - 1D perlin noise, value noise, octave noise
- 3D visualization:
    - 2D perlin, value, and octave
    - 3D perlin, value, and octave
- Text that says what going on
- Users can input to change what they see

What it won't have
- a movable camera (some default)

Alright, lets start? Yes. Where? What? 

To Do:
- Hello world
- Window opening
- Drawing hello triangle
- Set up shaders
- VBOs / geometry renders (cuboids, planes, lines, text, squares)


What should window do?
    - Should it also handle input? Not handle, but make it eaisly
      accesible?
    - error_callback for glfw?
